# The-first-Qt-exercise
a mini game which is used to practice how to use Qt.

In this game, avoid obstacles is the only key point.  
You can move by:  
**[←][→]** for **left** and **right**,  
**[↑]** for **jump** or **double jump**,  
**[↓]** for **fall quickly**,  
**[q]+[←|→|↓|space]** to **dash**, or named **flash**(space is for dash up).  

This game was inspired by some other games i have experienced,like  *Celeste*, *Hollow Knight*, *Ninja Must Die* and so on. However this mini game is just a coarse practice project.
